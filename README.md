:wave: Hi, I'm Wongu Kim and studying to be a data scientist. 
  
I'm majoring in **Statistics** and Consumer Science in SungKyunKwan University in Seoul, S.Korea. Plus, I have studied Computer Science since 2018. I have pretty much project experience using **Python** and R. I'm interested in ML/DL, especially **NLP and RecSys**. <!--Nowdays, I am studying text2image model by myself. -->
